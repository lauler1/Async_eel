# Async Eel

This project is a fork of the [Python Eel](https://github.com/python-eel/Eel) library.

It provides an **asynchronous version** of Eel, built using the **Quart** server framework.

The source code can be found in the `async_eel/` directory.

A working example is available in `examples/async_callbacks/`.

This project does not yet have a PyPI (pip) installation package, but it is already functional for the provided example.

Feel free to contribute!
